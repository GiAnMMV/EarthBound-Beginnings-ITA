*I tend to think# the same way, too.#|
*You should meet# him.#|
*I regained my# strength at Queen# Mary's fountain.#|
*The bad thing# about Queen Mary's# fountain is...#_*that it is so far# away, and so hard# to find.#|
*I am taking this# broken earring to# the fountain.#_*I'll bet it'll# change into a# magic earring.#|
*The mysterious# sound of the# fountain soothes.#|
*More to the south.# Are you lost?#_*Sorry...I was# directing you to# the rest room.#_*Queen Mary's# Fountain is west# of the castle.#|
*I bent my spoon# and it's hard to# use like this.#_*Do you think# somehow you could# fix it for me?#|

*Boo hoo hoo... You# should accept# kindness graciously.#|
*Oh, traveller! Why# don't you enjoy a# meal at our house?#_*Well.... Today's# special. Can you# guess what it is?#|
*Why not!? You sound# so suspicious!#|
*Yes, it's # ¹Ì×.#_*I knew you liked# ¹Ì×. Do you# want some?#|
*This was to be a# musical instrument# store,#_*but the Ocarina# that we ordered# never arrived.#_*So I've given up.#|

*Hey, kid! # How are you doing?#|
*There is no exit# from a place like# Magicant.#_*Ha ha ha...#|
*Outside?# A world outside?# What do you mean?#|
*I am so embarrassed!# I wish I could # crawl into a hole.#|
*I am the# Mysterious# Goods-Keeper.#_*You have a need?#|
*I am the# Mysterious# Mimicker.#|
*There are a great# many holes east of# town.#_*The sound of# another world can# be heard from one.#|
*Pull out a Red# Weed and place it# into the fountain,#_*it will turn into# the Magic Herb.#|

*The Queen isn't# feeling very well.#|
*Suspicious man....# I'll let you pass,#_*if you solve this# riddle...#|

*See you later!#|
*I wish I could# hear the Queen# sing again.#|
*Hello! I didn't hear# you come in.#_*That guitar playing# is so loud...#_*I can't even# think.#_*What?

*How happy I am# that you came to# see me.#_*I know what you# would like me to# do. Here!#|
*Listen to my song!# Oh music-loving# adventurer ¹£@!#_*Why do you cry,# oh Cupid-Doll?#_*Canary sings# so sadly.#_*Monkey sings,# Piano plays,#_*maybe there# is a ghost?#_*Desert Cactus# so alone,#_*every night# his sad, sad tone.#_*The Dragon sleeps,# the note remains.#_*Eve's last song# has no refrain.#_*On the Mount# named Itoi,#_*you must climb# high young boy.#_*See the XX Stone,# for the last tone,#_*then do not leave# Queen Mary alone!#_*La la lullaby...# Strange lullaby...#_*Bye bye bye...# Good-bye.#_*Sure is a nice# song, isn't it?#|
*Deep in the woods,# is a guitar player# who is a hermit.#_*Not that bad# looking of a# man...#_*Best of all,# he's quite a poet.#|
*Someone told me# about a man that#_*everyone forgot# about. But, I don't# remember who.#|
*Believe it or not,# I am a Healer.#_*I can charge your# PP, and can cure# stone-illness.#|
*...I thought so...#|
*Don't carry so much# money with you.#|
*Of course I am a# non-singing# monkey.#_*Normal monkeys# don't sing.# So, any questions?#|
*Anyhow...# questions are so# ridiculous.#|
*Good, I worried# that you would ask# a difficult one.#_*You look so much# like Queen Mary.#_*I wonder why?#|
*I just had to tell# you about it as# soon as I saw you.#_*The rails are# fixed, and the# train is on time.#|
*I wish I could go# into the castle to# see Queen Mary.#|
*Queen Mary often# has nightmares.#_*As if scolding a# naughty child,# she cries out,#_*”I am scared!# I am scared!”#_*And then she# starts to sing...# just a little bit.#_*Then she forgets# the tune, and# wakes in a sweat.#_*I wonder what sad# experience has done# this to Queen Mary?#|
*I only give this# to girls.#|
*Zzzzzzzzzzzz...#|
*You liar!#|
*All of us know you# don't belong here,#_*but we consider# you one of us.#_*With the Onyx# Hook, you can warp# back here anytime.#|

*Please SING to me# the melodies that# you have learned.#|
*Yes...# that's right.# That is the song.#|
*Oh! Giegue!#|
*In a bad dream,# Magicant vanished# into thin air.#_*My heart is still# pounding so hard.#|

It there any way to#defeat him?|
Don't let him stop#and unpack his trunk!|
Somebody ate his#porridge, and he isn't#too happy about it!|
Surprised? It really#does exist!|
Be careful of its#exhaust if you are#asthmatic.|
Hypnotism does not#work on this robot.|
Special armor protects#from PSI attack.|
It has, the awful#Stone of Origin.|
Something like this#should not exist on#the earth...|
Don't let this primate#punk pick on you!|
A face only a mother#could love.|
Watch those eyes!|
No one is in the#driver's seat.|
It has strong#friends.|
Its shell is#unbelievably hard.|
It uses hypnotism.|
Its quickness is the#source of its pride.|
Watch out for those#pearly whites.|
That thief!!|
Don't accept his#invitation to dinner.|
A walking fuel#supply.|
It seems to be#guarding something.|
He can be found#on the FBI's#most wanted list.|
Maybe he is not#really rotten to#the core.|
A malnourished robot?|
Do not be tricked by#her smile.|
A man from the stars.|
This thing could not#occur naturally|
What evil lab has#manufactured this#mobile brain.|
It uses various PSI#attack.|
It would be nice to#have armor of your#own.|
An animated tree with#suspicious actions.|
He has a short temper,#so be careful.|
He looks like he could#grow flowers in his#hair.|
Her refrigerator#shaped body holds a#heart of ice.|
A real bad apple,#stay out of his way.|
His twisted face#covers his twisted#mind.|
Careful, his 'Smash#Hit'is quite#effective.|
Watch out for further#sneak attacks.|
Watch your wallet and#count your change,#he's a thief.|
It might not poison,#maybe...|
He who laughs last#laughs best.|

It's poisonous, but#Insecticide works.|
Don't let yourself#get tied up fighting#this guy.|
It looks like it#jumped out of a comic#book.|
This enemy's face is#the easiest to draw.|
If he was a mask,#someone might mistake#your identity.|
Just an ordinary#ghost.|
Only as big as a#dinner plate.|
Life itself is a#puzzle for Mr.Bat.|
He is small, but it is#obvious that he is a#spaceman.|
Hold your nose!|
An evil, caped Zombie.#Beware, his#'Last strike' could#be devastating.|
A big rat, with a tail#this long.|
Shaped like an egg,#but a little tougher.|
It stares back at#you.|
It hovers in the#air!|
It's strong poison#was developed in a#laboratory.|
Beware of its poison#and Stone of Origin.|
Good experience, if it#doesn't run.|
It seems that it does#not have any friends.|
His chair was broken,#and he isn't very#happy!|
Where's that#antidote.|
Poison, poison,#poison.|
If he smiles, don't#smile back.|
Its father won't even#look at his face.|
Beware of its Stone#of Origin.|
I wonder if it carries#fleas?|
Hypnotism does not#work on the car.|
Hypnotism does not#work on this vehicle.|
What is going to#happen next, speeding,#reckless driving, or..|
Don't alarm this#ghost, he has#friends!|
The optometrists#favorite.|
Watch your step,#Dadseyes are every#where.|
Momseyes will spot#you for sure!|
It has friends!|
He only has PK Beam.|
As strong as on ox.|
Ragged around the#edges, but do not#underestimate it.|
The latest in the#product line.|
This is as big as a#manhole cover.|
Do not be tricked by#her beauty.|
It carries, and#likes to use Bombs.|
There is a plenty of#fuel inside.|
She is good at, and#not afraid to use a#strong PSI attack.|
His sole purpose is#to keep travelers#from passing through#the cave.|
It likes to use PK#Freeze.|
If you can beat it,#that is great.|
Not only will it#attack using PSI,#it is a thief!|
Careful, he knows#'Brain Shock'.|
”It attacks with#bare hands.”|
Its marvelous silver#coat glistens and#gleams.|
He is absolutely huge!|
If you must sleep,#don't borrow his bed!|
New and unfortunately,#improved.|
The strongest of#the Starmen.|
